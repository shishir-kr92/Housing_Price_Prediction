# Surprise Housing Investment Analysis
## Introduction
Welcome to the Surprise Housing Investment Analysis project! In this project, we aim to help the US-based housing company, Surprise Housing, enter the Australian market by building a regression model to predict the prices of prospective properties. By leveraging data analytics and regularization techniques, we will identify significant variables that influence house prices and determine the optimal values of lambda for Ridge and Lasso regression.

## Problem Statement
Surprise Housing intends to purchase houses in Australia at prices below their actual values and sell them at higher prices. To achieve this, we will analyze a dataset containing information about the sale of houses in Australia. Our goal is to build a regression model that accurately predicts house prices based on various independent variables. The model's insights will assist Surprise Housing in making informed investment decisions and maximizing returns in the Australian market.

## Dataset
The dataset provided is in CSV format and contains information about the sale of houses in Australia. It includes various independent variables such as the size of the house, number of bedrooms, location, etc., along with the target variable - the sale price of the house.

## Methodology
 - Data Preprocessing: We will start by exploring and cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables as necessary.
 - Feature Selection: Next, we will identify significant variables that influence house prices using regularization techniques such as Ridge and Lasso regression. This will help us narrow down the features that contribute most to the model's predictive power.
 - Model Building: We will build regression models using Ridge and Lasso regularization to predict house prices. These models will be trained on the dataset and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics.
 - Optimization: We will determine the optimal values of lambda for Ridge and Lasso regression to achieve the best balance between bias and variance.
 - Interpretation: Finally, we will interpret the results of our regression models to understand how various variables affect house prices in the Australian market.

## Results
The results of our analysis will include:
 - Identification of significant variables influencing house prices.
 - Evaluation of model performance using appropriate metrics.
 - Determination of the optimal values of lambda for Ridge and Lasso regression.
 - Insights into the pricing dynamics of the Australian housing market and recommendations for investment decisions.

## Conclusion
By leveraging data analytics and regularization techniques, we aim to provide Surprise Housing with valuable insights into the Australian housing market. Our regression model will help them understand pricing dynamics, identify profitable investment opportunities, and optimize their investment strategy for maximum returns.
